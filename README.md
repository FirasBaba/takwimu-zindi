# AI4D Takwimu Lab - Machine Translation Challenge - 3rd place

## Description
This repository contains the 3rd place solution for the AI4D Takwimu Lab - Machine Translation Challenge competition. The challenge focused on translating text from French into Fongbe or Ewe, two Nigerâ€“Congo languages that are part of the Gbe cluster. The competition aimed to address the communication barriers between local language speakers and modern society in West Africa.

## Problem Statement
Ewe and Fongbe are closely related tonal languages spoken in Togo, southeastern Ghana, and Benin. Despite being core to the economic and social life of major West African capital cities, they are rarely written, hindering access to critical facilities like education, banking, and healthcare for non-French/English speakers. The competition sought to develop a machine translation system to convert French text into Fongbe or Ewe, with the challenge of working efficiently with limited available data.
